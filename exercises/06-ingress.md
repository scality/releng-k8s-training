# Kubernetes Ingress

Ingress are the objects that will allow your application to be exposed to outside of your cluster, the rest of the world.

They're in other words the nginx configuration

## Setup the ingress

Create a `manifest/ingress.yaml` file containing the Ingress object

Once setup the following command should work on your computer:

```shell
curl localhost/k8s-intro 
Hello, World!
```
